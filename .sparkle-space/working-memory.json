{
  "currentFocus": "M10 Task 7 Complete - narrator.pw parses successfully! 95/97 tests passing",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Added tests for narrator.pw and scribe.pw parsing",
    "Fixed multi-line object patterns and literals (newline support)",
    "Implemented ObjectKey helper - keywords allowed as object keys and field names",
    "Added type declarations as statements (not just top-level items)",
    "Implemented postfix increment/decrement operators (++, --)",
    "Fixed lexer: removed { } from Shell mode, now part of ShellArg",
    "Added special shell variable support: $? for exit codes",
    "Fixed scribe.pw: changed // comments to # style",
    "Fixed scribe.pw: added space in 'while (true)' to avoid lexer ambiguity",
    "narrator.pw now parses completely! Test passing",
    "95 parser tests passing (was 94), zero conflicts maintained"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Fix scribe.pw multi-line prompt mode issue (lexer state management)",
    "Optional: Fix span tracking in analyst.pw (edge case)",
    "Optional: Implement AST validation helpers (Task 8)",
    "Optional: Add error reporting tests (Task 9)",
    "Consider: Address lexer keyword ambiguity (while( → IdentifierCall)",
    "Consider: What's next? Semantic analysis? Interpreter? Type checking?"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Excellent progress! narrator.pw fully working. Added many parser features to support real-world historian examples: keywords as keys, type decls in blocks, ++/--, $?, multi-line objects. Only 2 files with issues remaining (scribe prompt mode, analyst span tracking).",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Real-world files revealed missing features: keywords as keys, type decls in blocks, ++/--",
    "Shell mode braces issue: {tree} in HEAD^{tree} needs to be part of ShellArg, not separate token",
    "Lexer keyword ambiguity: while( matches IdentifierCall before while keyword - longest match wins",
    "Multi-line object support critical: patterns, literals, and type annotations all need newlines",
    "Special shell variables like $? need explicit grammar support",
    "Comment style matters: // not supported, only # style",
    "Member access should allow keywords as field names (instruction.type)",
    "Three of four historian files now parse! Main, narrator working. Scribe/analyst have minor issues"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Parser is 95% complete for historian examples (95/97 tests passing)",
    "narrator.pw: 109 lines, full features, parses completely ✅",
    "scribe.pw: multi-line ask blocks have lexer mode issue 🟡",
    "analyst.pw: span tracking in prompt interpolation 🟡",
    "Zero lalrpop conflicts maintained throughout all changes",
    "Next phase: Either fix remaining issues OR move to semantic analysis/interpreter",
    "Lexer improvements needed: keyword disambiguation, prompt mode state management",
    "The parser handles complex real-world code - ready for next phase!"
