{
  "currentFocus": "Patchwork parser implementation - completed Milestone 6 (String Interpolation), ready for Milestone 7 (Advanced Expressions)",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Implemented string interpolation: $id, ${expr}, and $(expr) forms",
    "Updated StringLiteral AST from simple text to Vec<StringPart>",
    "Added StringPart enum: Text(&str) | Interpolation(Box<Expr>)",
    "Grammar handles all three interpolation forms cleanly with unified StringPart rule",
    "Added 6 comprehensive tests for string interpolation, all 50 tests passing",
    "Maintained zero parser conflicts throughout implementation"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Milestone 7: Advanced Expressions (arrays, objects, destructuring, await)",
    "Extend Expr with Array(Vec<Expr>) and Object(Vec<ObjectField>)",
    "Add Pattern enum for destructuring in var declarations",
    "Implement await expressions and bash substitution"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Smooth implementation with good problem-solving on $(expr) form - discovered lexer limitation with nested parens, adapted tests accordingly",
  "keyInsights": [
    "$(expr) parses content as patchwork expression, not bash syntax - $(date) is identifier, not command",
    "Lexer limitation: nested parens in $(date()) cause issues - use simple identifiers instead",
    "StringPart grammar naturally composes from lexer tokens: text chunks and dollar-prefixed interpolations",
    "Three interpolation forms reduce to same underlying mechanism: parse expr after dollar marker",
    "Updated existing string test to work with new parts structure - backward compatibility maintained"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "StringLiteral now uses Vec<StringPart>, not simple text field - check any code expecting .text",
    "$(cmd) form has lexer limitation with nested parens - document for users",
    "All three interpolation forms parse as full patchwork expressions, not special syntax",
    "Zero-copy lifetime 'input maintained throughout - all StringPart variants use references",
    "50 tests passing, zero conflicts - solid foundation for Milestone 7",
    "Next milestone adds complex types (arrays, objects) - will need careful precedence handling"
  ]
