{
  "currentFocus": "Implemented tuple pattern matching and ignore patterns (_) in parser",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Added underscore (_) as a keyword in lexer, token enum, and adapter",
    "Extended Pattern AST enum with Ignore and Tuple variants",
    "Implemented tuple destructuring syntax: var (x, y, z) = expr",
    "Implemented ignore pattern: var _ = expr",
    "Tuple patterns support nesting: var (_, result, _) = spawn().await",
    "Added PatternList grammar rule for comma-separated patterns",
    "Updated AST dump to display tuple and ignore patterns",
    "Added 3 comprehensive tests for tuple patterns",
    "All 108 parser tests passing (up from 105)",
    "Historian.pw line 10 now parses correctly with tuple pattern"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Consider implementing parameter type annotations (description: string)",
    "Consider implementing throw statements",
    "Consider implementing nested tuple patterns",
    "Parser ready for more pattern matching enhancements"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Clean implementation of tuple patterns complete",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Underscore must be a keyword (not identifier) to prevent ambiguity",
    "Pattern::Tuple contains Vec<Pattern> allowing recursive nesting",
    "PatternList uses head/tail pattern like other comma-separated lists",
    "Tuple patterns work seamlessly with .await expressions"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Ignore pattern (_) is now reserved - cannot be used as identifier",
    "Tuple patterns are recursive - any pattern can appear inside",
    "Same 13 pre-existing test failures remain (unrelated features)",
    "Tuple pattern matching now enables historian.pw line 10 to parse"
  ]
