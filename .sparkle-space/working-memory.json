  "currentFocus": "Balanced braces implementation complete - analyst.pw now parsing!",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Implemented balanced braces with recursive grammar for prompts",
    "Added $'<char>' escape syntax for literal characters (rare edge cases)",
    "analyst.pw now parses successfully - code fence issue RESOLVED",
    "Test status improved from 93/96 to 99/100 passing",
    "Files parsing: 3/4 historian examples (only scribe.pw failing)",
    "Added 4 comprehensive tests for balanced braces and escape syntax",
    "Un-ignored test_parse_historian_analyst - now passing",
    "Comprehensive documentation in code-fence-issue-analysis.md"

  "nextSteps": [
    "Decision point: Fix multi-line ask blocks (scribe.pw) or move to semantic analysis",
    "Consider reporting UTF-8 bug to parlex maintainers",
    "Optional: Add fence-mode for explicit code blocks as future enhancement"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Excellent breakthrough session! Collaborative design discussion led to elegant recursive solution that's better than initially planned. David's suggestion to require balanced braces was the key insight.",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Balanced braces (99% case) can be handled with recursive grammar",
    "Prefixes (dollar, do) naturally disambiguate interpolation/code from text",
    "Escape syntax $'<char>' handles imbalanced edge cases cleanly",
    "Recursive PromptBlock flattens to text - no complex semantic handling needed",
    "Parser can handle what lexer can't - balance checking is parser-natural",
    "Design discussion process validated approach before implementation"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Only 1 known issue remaining: multi-line ask blocks (scribe.pw)",
    "UTF-8 bug still exists (workaround: ASCII arrows in examples)",
    "Balanced braces solution is proper fix, not a workaround",
    "Test status: 99/100 passing (excellent progress from 93/96)",
    "Imbalanced braces require escape syntax: $'{' or $'}'",
    "Interpolation and do-blocks work inside balanced braces"
