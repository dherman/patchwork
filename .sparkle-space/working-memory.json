{
  "currentFocus": "Patchwork parser implementation - Milestone 8 (Type System) completed, ready for Milestone 9 (Comments & Annotations)",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Milestone 8 complete: Full type system implemented with complex types",
    "All 74 tests passing (62 from M1-7 + 12 new M8 tests)",
    "Zero parser conflicts maintained throughout implementation",
    "Expanded TypeExpr enum with 5 variants: Name, Object, Array, Union, Literal",
    "Added TypeDeclItem for top-level type declarations (type name = TypeExpr)",
    "TypeFieldList handles newlines elegantly for readable formatting",
    "12 comprehensive tests cover all type features: simple, array, union, object, nested, literals"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Milestone 9: Comments & Annotations (handle comment tokens, decorator-style annotations)",
    "Consider whether to commit M8 work to git before starting M9",
    "Milestone 10: Full Historian Example Validation (parse all four example files)",
    "After parser complete: AST visitor pattern, pretty printer, semantic analysis"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Excellent systematic work - tackled type system methodically, zero technical debt",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Union types use manual precedence (lowest) - allows type1 | type2 | type3 parsing cleanly",
    "TypeFieldList mirrors other list patterns with newline support for formatting",
    "String literals in type position extract text via .parts.first() - validates no interpolation",
    "Type annotations appear in two places: Pattern::Identifier and ObjectPatternField",
    "Pattern-based VarDecl from M7 enabled clean type annotation support",
    "lalrpop's manual precedence climbing scales well - added union types with zero conflicts"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "TypeExpr has 5 variants now - all pattern matches need wildcards for exhaustiveness",
    "TypeField has optional bool field (unused now) for future key?: type syntax",
    "TypeFieldList allows newlines - multiline object types work like expected",
    "String literal types (Literal variant) assume simple strings - interpolation treated as empty",
    "74 tests passing validates complete M1-8 implementation",
    "Zero parser conflicts maintained across all 8 milestones",
    "Type declarations are top-level items, not statements"
