{
  "currentFocus": "Patchwork parser implementation - completed Milestone 4 (Basic Expressions), ready for Milestone 5 (Prompt Expressions)",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Implemented full expression parsing: literals, binary/unary ops, calls, member access, indexing",
    "Built manual precedence climbing grammar (10 tiers) avoiding lalrpop conflicts",
    "Added 14 comprehensive tests covering all expression types including precedence validation",
    "All 38 tests passing (24 from M1-3 + 14 new M4 tests), zero conflicts"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Milestone 5: Prompt Expressions (think/ask/do blocks - patchwork's unique features)",
    "Implement PromptBlock and PromptItem AST types",
    "Add grammar for prompt expressions with embedded code blocks"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Excellent momentum - tackled and solved lalrpop precedence challenges together, clean solution emerged",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Manual precedence climbing > lalrpop #[precedence] for complex grammars - explicit hierarchy prevents conflicts",
    "Each precedence tier as separate rule: AssignExpr → PipeExpr → OrExpr → ... → PostfixExpr → PrimaryExpr",
    "Keywords like 'self' need explicit grammar rules even when they seem like identifiers",
    "Test-driven development caught the 'self' issue immediately"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Precedence: Assignment (lowest) → Pipe → OR → AND → Comparison → Range → Add/Sub → Mul/Div → Unary → Postfix (highest)",
    "Zero-copy lifetime 'input pattern must be maintained throughout",
    "StringLiteral is currently simple (no interpolation) - Milestone 6 will add ${} support"
