{
  "currentFocus": "Patchwork parser implementation - Milestone 7 (Advanced Expressions) completed, ready for Milestone 8 (Type System)",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Milestone 7 complete: arrays, objects, destructuring, await all implemented",
    "All 62 tests passing (50 from M1-6 + 12 new M7 tests)",
    "Zero parser conflicts maintained throughout implementation",
    "Major refactor: VarDecl now uses Pattern-based approach instead of simple name",
    "Pattern::Identifier changed to struct variant with optional type_ann support",
    "Updated all existing tests to work with new Pattern structure"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Milestone 8: Type System (expand TypeExpr, add type declarations)",
    "Consider whether to commit M7 work to git before starting M8",
    "Milestone 8 will add: object types, array types, union types, literal types",
    "Add type declarations: type name = TypeExpr"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Productive session - tackled complex refactoring systematically, all tests passing cleanly",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Pattern-based VarDecl is more elegant: unifies simple and destructuring declarations",
    "Pattern::Identifier { name, type_ann } supports both var x and var x: type naturally",
    "Object shorthand {x, y} means {x: x, y: y} - None for value field",
    "Await is a unary operator like ! and -, placed in UnaryExpr tier",
    "Bash substitution $(cmd) already works via string interpolation infrastructure",
    "Breaking changes require systematic test updates - found 6 locations to fix"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "VarDecl structure changed: pattern field replaced name and type_ann fields",
    "Pattern::Identifier is now struct variant, not tuple - use { name, .. } in matches",
    "Object literals don't handle newlines between fields - keep on one line for now",
    "62 tests passing, includes comprehensive coverage of M7 features",
    "Zero-copy lifetime 'input maintained throughout all new types",
    "Manual precedence climbing continues to work perfectly - no conflicts",
    "Milestone 8 will need to expand TypeExpr from simple Name to complex types"
