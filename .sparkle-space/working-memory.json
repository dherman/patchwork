  "session_focus": "Migrated parser from 'agent' to 'worker' keyword and replaced 'fail' with 'throw' as unary operator",
  "completed_work": [
    "Changed 'agent' keyword to 'worker' throughout lexer, parser, AST, and tests",
    "Changed 'fail' statement to 'throw' unary prefix operator",
    "Updated lexer: Agent→Worker, Fail→Throw tokens",
    "Updated parser grammar: AgentDecl→WorkerDecl, removed FailStmt, added throw to UnaryExpr",
    "Updated AST: Item::Worker, WorkerDecl struct, UnOp::Throw enum variant",
    "Updated adapter.rs and ast_dump.rs for new tokens",
    "Fixed bug in analyst.pw: ${changeset_description} → ${description}",
    "Updated all 124 tests - all passing",
    "Fixed test collision where 'worker' was used as identifier"

  "key_decisions": [
    "Worker keyword indicates second-class agents (not general-purpose)",
    "Throw as unary operator allows throwing arbitrary expressions (like JavaScript)",
    "More expressive than statement-based fail: throw 'error message', throw {code: 500}",
    "Maintained 'Agent' as valid type name for trait inheritance"
