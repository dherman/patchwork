  "currentFocus": "M10 Step 8 complete - AST validation helpers and tests implemented",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Created ast_dump.rs module with pretty-printing visitor for AST",
    "Implemented hierarchical tree dumping for all AST node types",
    "Added 6 new validation tests checking AST structure",
    "All tests passing: 109 parser tests, 57 lexer tests",
    "Validated command substitution, bare commands, string interpolation, and think/ask patterns",
    "Updated parser-implementation-plan.md to mark Step 8 complete"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Ready to commit M10 Step 8 completion",
    "Optional: Step 9 (error reporting tests) or move to next phase",
    "Discuss next direction: AST visitor, pretty printer, semantic analysis, or interpreter"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Step 8 complete - clean checkpoint for deciding next phase",
  "keyInsights": [
    "AST dump helper is useful for both testing and debugging",
    "Validation tests check structure programmatically, not just parse success",
    "main.pw has 'await task ...' syntax not yet implemented - used simplified version",
    "Test count grew from 107 to 109 with new validation tests",
    "All historian example files (that don't use unimplemented syntax) parse correctly"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Full main.pw requires 'await task ...' parallel task syntax (not yet implemented)",
    "Step 9 (error reporting) marked optional in plan",
    "Parser implementation complete for all documented features",
    "Ready for next phase discussion: visitor pattern, pretty printer, semantics, or interpreter"
