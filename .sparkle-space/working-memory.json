  "currentFocus": "Parser enhancements complete - shell operators as first-class AST nodes",
  "recentAchievements": [
    "Removed Placeholder variant from Expr enum (cleanup complete)",
    "Implemented task(...) operator for parallel execution with proper syntax",
    "Added prompt block text node merging during parsing for cleaner AST",
    "Enhanced AST with proper shell operator structure (ShellPipe, ShellAnd, ShellOr, ShellRedirect)",
    "Shell operators now first-class expressions with correct precedence, not literal arguments",
    "Created patchwork-parser CLI tool for AST inspection",
    "All tests passing: 113 parser tests, 57 lexer tests",
    "analyst.pw parses correctly with proper shell operator semantics"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Parser is feature-complete for all planned milestones",
    "Ready for next phase: AST visitor pattern, pretty printer, semantic analysis, or interpreter",
    "Optional: Error reporting tests (Step 9) if desired",
    "Consider documenting the shell operator enhancement in parser-design.md"
  ],
  "collaborativeState": "Major enhancements complete - parser now has clean semantic AST representation",
  "keyInsights": [
    "Shell operators benefit from proper AST representation rather than string literals",
    "Parser precedence hierarchy: || < && < | < redirects < commands",
    "Text merging in prompts reduces AST complexity significantly",
    "task(...) syntax avoids LALR(1) conflicts better than prefix operator",
    "CommandSubst now wraps arbitrary shell expressions, not just simple commands"
  ],
  "criticalAwareness": [
    "Shell operator precedence: || (lowest) > && > | > redirects (highest)",
    "RedirectOp enum includes: Out, Append, In, ErrOut, ErrToOut",
    "CommandSubst changed from {name, args} to Box<Expr> wrapper",
    "All historian examples parse with full shell operator semantics",
    "Parser ready for interpreter implementation or further tooling"
